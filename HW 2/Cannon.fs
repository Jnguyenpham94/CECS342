(* text-based game in which the player attempts to shoot cannonballs at a target that is some
distance away. The player repeatedly enters an angle to fire the cannon at and an amount of gunpowder
to use. The game calculates how far the cannonball will fly under those parameters and continues until the
cannonball falls within 1 meter of the target.
